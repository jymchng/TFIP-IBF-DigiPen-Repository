    "# Data Preparation Without Data Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation is the process of transforming raw data into a form that is appropriate for modeling. A naive approach to preparing data applies the transform on the entire dataset before evaluating the performance of the model. This results in a problem referred to as data leakage, where knowledge of the hold-out test set leaks into the dataset used to train the model. This can result in an incorrect estimate of model performance when making predictions on new data. A careful application of data preparation techniques is required in order to avoid data leakage, and this varies depending on the model evaluation scheme used, such as train-test splits or $k$-fold cross-validation. In this exercise, you will discover how to avoid data leakage during data preparation when evaluating machine learning models. After completing this exercise, you will know:\n",

    "The manner in which data preparation techniques are applied to data matters. A common approach is to first apply one or more transforms to the entire dataset. Then the dataset is split into train and test sets or $k$-fold cross-validation is used to fit and evaluate a machine learning model.\n",

    "Although this is a common approach, it is dangerously incorrect in most cases. The problem with applying data preparation techniques before splitting data for model evaluation is that it can lead to data leakage and, in turn, will likely result in an incorrect estimate of a model's performance on the problem. Data leakage refers to a problem where information about the holdout dataset, such as a test or validation dataset, is made available to the model in the training dataset. This leakage is often small and subtle but can have a marked effect on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage means that information is revealed to the model that gives it an unrealistic advantage to make better predictions. This could happen when test data is leaked into the training set, or when data from the future is leaked to the past. Any time that a model is given information that it shouldn't have access to when it is making predictions in real time in production, there is leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get data leakage by applying data preparation techniques to the entire dataset. This is not a direct type of data leakage, where we would train the model on the test dataset. Instead, it is an indirect type of data leakage, where some knowledge about the test dataset, captured in summary statistics is available to the model during training. This can make it a harder type of\n",
    "data leakage to spot, especially for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other aspect of resampling is related to the concept of information leakage which is where the test set data are used (directly or indirectly) during the training process. This can lead to overly optimistic results that do not replicate on future\n",
    "data points and can occur in subtle ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the case where we want to normalize data, that is scale input variables to the range between 0 to 1. When we normalize the input variables, this requires that we fist calculate the minimum and maximum values for each variable before using these values to scale the variables. The dataset is then split into train and test datasets, but the examples in the training\n",
    "dataset know something about the data in the test dataset; they have been scaled by the global minimum and maximum values, so they know more about the global distribution of the variable then they should.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get the same type of leakage with almost all data preparation techniques; for example, standardization estimates the mean and standard deviation values from the domain in order to scale the variables. Even models that impute missing values using a model or summary statistics will draw on the full dataset to fill in values in the training dataset. The solution is straightforward. Data preparation must be fit on the training dataset only. That is, any coefficients or models prepared for the data preparation process must only use rows of data in the training dataset. Once fit, the data preparation algorithms or models can then be applied to the training dataset, and to the test dataset.\n",

As with the train-test example in the previous section, removing data leakage has resulted in a slight improvement in performance when our intuition might suggest a drop given that data leakage often results in an optimistic estimate of model performance. Nevertheless, the examples demonstrate that data leakage may impact the estimate of model performance and how to correct data leakage by correctly performing data preparation after the data is split.\n",
